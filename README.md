# UX - A's for Days

This contains the final prototype for the application, A's for Days.  This project was completed as Team 03 for an intro to usability engineering course.  The purpose of this application is to provide an area for tutors, study groups, and students to each find one another to hire services or just to participate.

The pdf is interactive with the buttons traveling throughout the PDF document to the appropriate page.  The prototype was build using myBasalmiq.
